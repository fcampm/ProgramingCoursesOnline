 * Details: In this program we are going to learn the different relational operators that we can use in the if statements. It exists different kind of this opearators, 
 * some examples are:
 * 1. > (greater than).
 * 2. < (lower than).
 * 3. >= (greater or equal than).
 * 4. <= (lower or equal than).
 * 5. == (equal than).
 * 6. != (different than).
 *
 * Also it exists the logical operators that we use when we need to have more than one condition or another condition, etc:
 * 1. && (logic and).
 * 2. || (logic or).
 * 3. ! (logic not).
